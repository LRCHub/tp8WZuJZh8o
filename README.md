```lrc
[00:14.86] You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
[00:18.83] You tell me to come over, there's some games you want to play
[00:22.58] I'm walking to your house, nobody's home
[00:26.12] Just me and you and you and me alone
[00:30.61] We're just playing hide and seek
[00:33.06] It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
[00:38.23] I don't want to play no games
[00:40.79] I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
[00:45.99] I don't give a fuck about you anyways
[00:49.74] Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
[00:53.55] You never share your toys or communicate
[00:57.33] I guess I'm just a play date to you
[01:09.31] Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
[01:12.76] When I try to talk you're always playing board games
[01:16.59] I wish I had monopoly over your mind
[01:20.61] I wish I didn't care all the time
[01:24.41] We're just playing hide and seek
[01:26.95] It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
[01:32.23] I don't want to play no games
[01:34.82] I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
[01:39.99] I don't give a fuck about you anyways
[01:43.59] Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
[01:47.39] You never share your toys or communicate
[01:50.99] I guess I'm just a play date to you
[01:56.15] Ring around the rosy
[01:59.94] I never know, I never know what you need
[02:03.74] Ring around the rosy, I want to give you, want to give you
[02:09.92] What you need
[02:16.40] I don't give a fuck about you anyways
[02:20.31] Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
[02:24.18] You never share your toys or communicate
[02:27.65] I guess I'm just a play date to you
[02:39.65] You know I give a fuck about you everyday
[02:43.33] Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
[02:47.16] If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
[02:51.07] Don't want to leave this play date with you
